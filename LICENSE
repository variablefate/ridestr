copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

1. The above copyright notice and this permission notice (including the full text
   of this Addendum) must be included in all copies or substantial portions of
   the Software, and must be preserved without alteration in any modification
   or derivative work.

2. No-Shitcoin Restriction (Mandatory Preservation):
   The Software, and any modification, derivative work, combined work, or
   distribution thereof, may not incorporate, integrate, promote, facilitate,
   support, or otherwise include any functionality, features, integrations,
   promotions, marketing, code, dependencies, documentation, or references
   related to "shitcoins" or similar speculative, memetic, low-utility, or
   high-risk cryptocurrencies/tokens. This prohibition includes (without limitation):

   - Memecoins, pump-and-dump tokens, rug-pull prone assets, joke coins,
     wrapped tokens representing assets, or any non-Bitcoin cryptocurrency,
     token, or blockchain.
   - Wallets, trading pairs, swaps, staking, airdrops, rewards, bridges,
     or promotional materials tied to such assets.

   This restriction must be imposed identically on all downstream recipients,
   and any license or distribution of a modified or derivative version of the
   Software must include this exact No-Shitcoin Restriction clause (including
   this sentence requiring its preservation). Violation of this restriction
   voids the permission granted herein for the violating party and all
   subsequent derivatives.

Exception: This restriction does not apply to fiat-based payment processing,
fiat on-ramps/off-ramps, or traditional financial integrations (e.g., credit/debit
cards, bank transfers, stable fiat currencies such as USD, EUR).
