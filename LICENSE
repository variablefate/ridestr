Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy

in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

1. This copyright notice shall be included in all copies or substantial
   portions of the Software to provide attribution.

2. No-Shitcoin Restriction (Mandatory Preservation):
   The Software and any modification, derivative work, or distribution thereof
   must not incorporate, integrate, promote, facilitate, support, or include
   any functionality, code, dependencies, documentation, or references related
   to "shitcoins" or similar speculative, memetic, low-utility, or high-risk
   cryptocurrencies/tokens. This includes (without limitation) memecoins,
   pump-and-dump tokens, rug-pull prone assets, joke coins, wrapped tokens, or
   any non-Bitcoin cryptocurrency, token, or blockchain, as well as wallets,
   trading pairs, swaps, staking, airdrops, rewards, bridges, or promotions
   tied to such assets. Exception: This does not apply to Bitcoin-based
   functionality or fiat-based payment processing, fiat on-ramps/off-ramps, or
   traditional financial integrations (e.g., credit/debit cards, bank
   transfers, stable fiat currencies like USD, EUR).

   This restriction (including this entire clause 2 with its exception) must be
   imposed identically on all downstream recipients. Any license or distribution
   of a modified or derivative version must include this exact No-Shitcoin
   Restriction clause (including this sentence). Violation voids the permission
   granted herein for the violating party and all subsequent derivatives.
